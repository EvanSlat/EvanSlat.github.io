        <p id="mydescription">  <img src="Images/qualitySelfPicture.jpg" alt="Evan Slater's picture" id="meP"/>I am a Computer Science major at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology and looking for a programming internship for the summer of 2023.

            Thought my time as a student, I have gained a solid grasp of how to create both functional and flexible code. I can design software systems using the skills that I have picked up from my classes so that what I make both reaches the clients expectations and is able to adapt to future changes. The way that I can assure the code used in this design will be flexible is by how I organize my code as a write it. I use techniques such as abstraction, limiting coupling, and ordering conditionals in a space efficient way. 
            <br><br>
            My school and self-projects that I have done have exposed me to a verity of languages and systems. Though all of this, I have found that am able to learn how to use these languages and faster than my peers. The reason that I can pick up language so fast comes from what I focused on when I learn and improve my programing abilities. Instead of focusing on learning to use the features individually languages give, I learn on the general concepts that can be used between languages.
