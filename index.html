        <p>  <img src="Images/qualitySelfPicture.jpg" alt="Evan Slater's picture" id="meP"/>I am a Computer Science major at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology and looking for a programming internship for the summer of 2023.<br><br>

            I have learned how to use languages like Java, Python, and SQL as well as programming practices that lead to better-developed programs in both efficiency and readability.<br><br>
            
            I am passionate about creating programs that are as efficient as they can be while keeping the script easy to follow and make modifications to.<br>
            I also enjoy learning in my downtime, the main area that I seek is mathematics and its applications. This has led me to be on course to obtain a math minor.<br>
