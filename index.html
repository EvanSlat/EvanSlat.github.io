        <p>  <img src="Images/qualitySelfPicture.jpg" alt="Evan Slater's picture" id="meP"/>I am very into programing and like to do it both as
            work and a way to put my thoughts into a reality. I am able to understand other perspectived due to how I
            enjoe seein the world through the eyes of others. While my spelling is bad, I am skilled when it comes to
            programing and trying to
            figure out how to do a set problem.
            I have my own hobbys, those being trading card games and table top role play games, maily Dungeions and
            dragons type things.
