        <p> The main constant between each of the version is the wording and the main calculaiton works.
            How they work is by having a ring of numbered points and a number called the degree
            Each point number is multiplyed by the degree and a line is drawn from the inital point to the 
            point whos number is the same as the calculated one. There is a wrap around system set it place.
            A more mathematical way to represent this is (P,P*d) where this is the set of points to link.

                    <p>This is the oldest version that I have, Version 4.
                        This version used Java and currently is the version that can handle the highest detail
                        It is used via typing in the starting paramiters after opening the program and will run
                        endlessly after that.

                    <p>The next iteration that I made what using desmose. Since this allowed me to have more 
                        freedom with manipulating the values. This came with a heavy sacrifice of power, not letting 
                        it be nearly as detailed as its java version.

                <p>The most resent version of NeetCurve that I have made was for my graphics class.
                    This version has a good traid off regarding detail to usability. 
                    There is a number pad, with out the numbers labled on them, that lets you actively change the degree.
                     Also you are able to pause and resume this version as well
