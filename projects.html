                            enviorment to create it in. Currently It is on version 6 but versions 1,2,3 have been lost.

                            The background for this project is a shape called a Cardioid. This shape uses a
                            constant multiplyer to connect points together with a line and NeetCurve is like
                            an animation of what happens when the constant is slownly increasing

                        still incorperate custom code to add features to the site that are not normaly avalible with the
