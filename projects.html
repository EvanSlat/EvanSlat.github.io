                        <p>This is one of my semi ongoing projects that I tend to recreate when I have a new
                            enviorment to create it in. Currently It is on version 6 but versions 1,2,3 have been lost.

                            The background for this project is a shape called a Cardioid. This shape uses a
                            constant multiplyer to connect points together with a line and NeetCurve is like
                            an animation of what happens when the constant is slownly increasing

                    <p>Resently I have startd working with older organizations that are not huge but do need a website.
                        Im most
                        of these cases the websites are not made entirely from scratch but using tools like squarespace
                        but
                        still incorperate custom code to add features to the site that are not normaly avalible with the
                        tools
                        given</p>

                    taking a few weeks to create and throuought the whole prosses we had development meeting and set
                    milestones for ourselfs</p>
