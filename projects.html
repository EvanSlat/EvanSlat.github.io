            <p>This was one of my first projects that I made it is currenly on its 4th generation and I feel satisfyed at this point with it. The shape that starting this project was the Cardioid, which uses a constant multiplyer to connect points together with a line. My next thought was, what is that constant changed. NeetCurve is the creation of an animated cardioid with the constant slowly increasing over time</p>
